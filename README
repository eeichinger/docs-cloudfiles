Cloud Files Documentation
=========================

There are two distinct documents in this repository.

* Introduction - Introduce new users to Cloud Files
* Developer Guide - Document the Cloud Files ReST interface

Each Cloud Files doc resides in it's own sub-directory.  The docs
are written in reStructuredText markup format.  Sphinx is used to
convert the raw rst into HTML and PDF.

    reST: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
  sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

Each project was created with 'sphinx-quickstart'.  The only
non-defaults answers supplied to sphinx-quickstart were to specify the
project's main doc name (rather than 'index') and to specify .txt
extenstion instead of .rst.  The Sphinx conf.py files were also
tweaked to remove the search/navigation features.

In each project dir, run 'make <builder>' to generate the docs where
'builder' is either 'html' or 'latex'.  The PDF format can be generated
from the latex source.  On a Debian system, there are a slew of latex
packages (including fonts) that need to be installed before the PDF
can be generated.

HTML example::

    $ cd cf-devguide
    $ make html
    $ firefox _build/html/cf-devguide.html &

PDF example::

    $ cd cf-devguide
    $ make latex
    $ cd _build/latex
    $ # edit _build/latex/Makefile and remove the "-makeindex" lines
    $ make all-pdf
